## Tech Used

### Some of the tech used includes:
- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
	- I use **AngularJS** to handle page routing, I also use it to make calls to the REST API and build custom directives.
	- AngularJS is used to create the search box function for the recipe database and to dynamically route the partial HTML files in to the view of the content area of the web page.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
	- **npm** to help manage some of the dependencies in the application
- [bower](https://bower.io/)
	- **Bower** is used to manage the installation of the libraries and frameworks
 
## Contributing

### Getting the code up and running
1. Firstly you will need to clone this repository by running the ```git clone <project's Github URL>``` command
2. After you've done that you'll need to make sure that you have **npm** and **bower** installed
  1. You can get **npm** by installing Node from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  2. Once you've done this you'll need to run the following command:
  	 `npm install -g bower # this may require sudo on Mac/Linux`
3. Once **npm** and **bower** are installed, you'll need to install all of the dependencies in *package.json* and *bower.json*
  ```
  npm install

  bower install
  ```
4. After those dependencies have been installed you'll need to make sure that you have **http-server** installed. You can install this by running the following: ```npm install -g http-server # this also may require sudo on Mac/Linux```
5. Once **http-server** is installed run ```http-server```
6. The project will now run on [localhost](http://127.0.0.1:8080)
7. Make changes to the code and if you think it belongs in here then just submit a pull request


```javascript
function greet(target) {
	console.log("Hello, " + target + "!");
}

greet("World");
```

## Site Testing

The site was tested on the following browswers:

- Internet explorer
	- Appearance:
		The site dispalyed correctly apart from a few aspects. The image behind the "Cooking Guide" logo text disappears when the site is viewed on screens above 1200px.
		When the screen size is anything below 1200px the logo displays correctly but the search box loses its orange box.
		The site functions as intended at all screen sizes from 320px an dupwards.
